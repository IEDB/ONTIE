documented exposure without evidence for disease	process		A process in which an organism is exposed to a substance which is evident from process having been observed or documented.	A restaurant worker tests positive for presence of Norovirus, but experiences no symptoms of illness.	
environmental exposure to endemic/ubiquitous agent without evidence for disease	process		A process in which an organism's exposure to a material entity is assumed from that material being commonly present in the environment of the organism.

exposure to substance without evidence for disease	process		An unplanned process in which an organism comes into contact with a substance without evidence for a disease caused by that exposure.	Exposure of a human to Timothy grass pollen without any allergic symptoms.	
exposure with existing immune reactivity without evidence for disease	process		A process in which an organism is exposed to a material entity which is evident by a detectable immune reactivity against it.
