vaccination	planned process	Administering a vaccine to an organism with the intention of inducing immunity against antigen components of the vaccine.	Administeration of the annual flu vacccine to a human subject.
documented exposure without evidence for disease	process	A process in which an organism is exposed to a substance which is evident from process having been observed or documented.	A restaurant worker tests positive for presence of Norovirus, but experiences no symptoms of illness.
environmental exposure to endemic/ubiquitous agent without evidence for disease	process	A process in which an organism's exposure to a material entity is assumed from that material being commonly present in the environment of the organism.

exposure to substance without evidence for disease	process	An unplanned process in which an organism comes into contact with a substance without evidence for a disease caused by that exposure.	Exposure of a human to Timothy grass pollen without any allergic symptoms.
exposure with existing immune reactivity without evidence for disease	process	A process in which an organism is exposed to a material entity which is evident by a detectable immune reactivity against it.

occurrence of asymptomatic infection	biological process	A process in which an infectious agent is in or on the body of an organism without causing detectable disease.	A restaurant worker tests positive for presence of Norovirus, but experiences no symptoms of illness.
infectious challenge	administering substance in vivo	Administering an infectious agent to an organism in order to test if and how an infection will occurr	Administration of Leishmania major into Balb/c mice after they were immunized with a peptide vaccine in order to test if the vaccine results in less disease symptoms when compared to mice who did not receive the vaccine.
